# SUPERPOWERS TUTORIAL #1 SUPER PONG
## *Start to learn game development with PONG*

*Tutorial series : How to learn to make video games by using Superpowers #1.*

My plan is to provide a tutorial series of game development process as my
learning go and to share my adventures in Superpowers with the community.
Of course I am always eager to learn and this tutorials can always be improved,
this is why I stick to the open source philosophy of the community and let anyone
open issues and fix the tutorials to allow everyone to adopt them.

Two ways to help, you can address in this tutorial post your problems, propose change
and ask for tutorial clarity. Or if you feel comfortable with that, you can improve them
directly by submitting issues and propose pull requests for the markdown files in the [github repository][1].

Please, don't hesitate to say if you find mistakes, missing elements or unclear steps as it
would help to improve this tutorials aimed to the Superpowers community.

 Thank you and have fun making gamesÂ !

*SUPERPOWERS TUTORIAL #2 will be a Tic Tac Toe with IA step by step tutorial*
