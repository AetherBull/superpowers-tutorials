### What we will learn in this tutorial

- Set up assets and build a scene for a Tic Tac Toe in Superpowers
- Write a mouse behavior for the player to choose how to play by clicking on an object
- Write functions inside a namespace to access it later from our others scripts
- Write a simple AI that check a game situation to make responds accordingly
- Superpowers and TypeScript API methods used:
   - Sup.Math.Ray()
   - Math.floor and Math.random
   - Sup.Actor()
   - Actor.addBehavior()
   - Sup.getActor().destroy()
